### **Objective of the Project**
The primary goal of this project is to analyze Amazon sales data to gain insights into factors that influence sales across various cities and branches. By employing SQL for data exploration, we aim to identify sales trends, customer behaviors, and product performance.

### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains sales records from three cities in Myanmar (Naypyitaw, Yangon, and Mandalay) and their respective branches (A, B, and C). The sales data spans the first quarter of 2019, with 1,000 records across 17 fields, including:
- **Key fields**: Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer Type, Gender, Product Line, Unit Price, Quantity, VAT, Total, Date, Time, Payment Method, COGS, Gross Margin Percentage, Gross Income, and Rating.

### **Data Preparation Steps**
1. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to aid the analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing initial analysis to understand the data patterns and distribution.

### **Analyses Conducted**
1. **Sales Analysis**: Understanding sales trends across cities and branches.
2. **Product Analysis**: Examining product performance and revenue by product line.
3. **Customer Analysis**: Analyzing customer demographics, preferences, and purchasing patterns.

### **Key Questions Addressed**
- How many distinct product lines are in the dataset?
- Which payment method is most commonly used?
- Which product line achieves the highest sales volume?
- What is the revenue generated each month?
- Which product line generates the highest revenue?
- Which city records the highest revenue?
- Which product line incurs the highest VAT?
- Which customer type appears most frequently?
- Which branch surpasses the average number of products sold?
- What is the most common product line associated with each gender?
- Which customer type contributes the highest revenue?
- What day of the week receives the highest customer rating per branch?

…and more.
